### Chatty App
=====================

A client-side SPA (single-page app) built with ReactJS, Webpack, Babel, Node.js and Web Sockets. The client-side app communicates with a server via WebSockets for multi-user real-time updates. No persistent database is involved; the focus is on the client-side experience.


A minimal and light dev environment for ReactJS.
